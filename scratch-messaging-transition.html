                <h2>Is there anything that I need to do?</h2>
                <p>In most cases, nothing. Chances are that you see this page after an extension update, which means that Scratch Addons is already installed. If you have something you need to say about this change, create a new issue <a href="https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/issues">here</a>.</p>
